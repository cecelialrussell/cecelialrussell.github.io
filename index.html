                    <h3>HRO Task Wizard</h3>
                    <p>
                        Developed an automated task tracking system using Microsoft SharePoint and 
                        Power Automate. Prior to development, I interviewed stakeholders to determine
                        workflow and requirements. The solution is color coded by deadline and includes 
                        daily email notifications to divisions of tasks due to the Director's Suite 
                        each day. I also created alerts to notify divisions if task was still pending 
                        one hour prior to deadline. In addition to development, I tested the solution, 
                        created documentation, and presented the solution to end users.

                    <h3>VRE Concurrence</h3>
                    <p>
                        Developed a custom tracking system for VR&E division using Microsoft Forms, Microsoft
                        SharePoint, and Power Automate. Prior to development, I interviewed stakeholders 
                        to draft workflows and gather requirements. The Microsoft Form is dynamic and 
                        includes branching. Power Automate flows serve to notify managers of submissions 
                        that need review and approval. Upon approval, requestors are notified of resolution.                        
                        In addition to development, I tested the solution, created documentation, and 
                        presented the solution to end users.
